# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Harvester team supports responsible disclosure and endeavors to resolve
security issues in a reasonable timeframe. To report a security vulnerability,
email security-rancher@suse.com. You may (but are not required to) use GPG for
encrypted communication. For encryption key details, please see
https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security

We currently do not have a bounty rewards program in place, and nor do we offer
swags. However, we genuinely appreciate the vigilance and expertise of our user
community in helping us maintain the highest security standards.

We strive to ackknowledge receiving submissions within 5 working days, please
wait until that time has past before asking for a status update.

The information contained in your report must be treated as embargoed and must
not be shared publicly, unless explicitly agreed with us first. This is to
protect the Rancher ecosystem users and enable us to follow through our
coordinated disclosure process. The information shall be kept embargoed until
a fix is released.

### What information to provide

Feel free to get in touch in whatever way works best for you! However, if
you're able to include the information below in your report, that would be
incredibly helpful and much appreciated:

- Product name and version where the issue was observed. If the issue was
  observed on the source code, the link to the specific code in GitHub instead.
- Description of the problem.
- Type of the issue and impact when exploited.
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept.

The more information you provide, the faster we will be able to reproduce the
issue and address your concerns more effectively.
